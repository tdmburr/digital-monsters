# README Digital Monsters

## Description
This is a light application, made using React, to view a small collection of digimon. The digimon "card" can be clicked to view additional information about the digimon in the form of its stage of digivolution! They can also be filtered via a dropdown to view a list of digimon that fall under that digivolution category. For the avid digimon lovers out there!

This application was created to allow an individual to experience a small amount of the thing they may enjoy, digimon.
